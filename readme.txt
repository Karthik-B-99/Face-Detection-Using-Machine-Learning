Face recognition system idetifies people on face images or video frames. In a nutshell, a face recognition system extracts features from an input face image and compares them to the features of labelled faces in a database.<br> 
The three major steps involved in this system are:-<br> 
i) Face Detection - OpenCV is used for real-time face detection. Haar Cascade alogirthm is used to detect the facial features.<br> 
ii) Face Extraction - Importing various os librarires and creating dataset directory to store the resultant images captured.<br> 
iii) Face Recognition - CNN is used for training the model. CNN automatically detects the important features, thus reducing time and effort, but at the ame time increasing system efficiency.<br>  
Steps to run the project:-<br>
• Run the 'dataset.py' file and provide the path to store the images.
• Run 'training.py'
• Run 'detection.py' and replace your name in the code.
