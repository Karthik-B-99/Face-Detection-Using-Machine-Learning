Face recognition system idetifies people on face images or video frames. In a nutshell, a face recognition system extracts features from an input face image and compares them to the features of labelled faces in a database.<br> 
The three major steps involved in this system are:-
i) Face Detection - OpenCV is used for real-time face detection. Haar Cascade alogirthm is used to detect the facial features.
ii) Face Extraction - Importing various os librarires and creating dataset directory to store the resultant images captured.
iii) Face Recognition - CNN is used for training the model. CNN automatically detects the important features, thus reducing time and effort, but at the ame time increasing system efficiency.
Steps to run the project:-
• Run the 'dataset.py' file and provide the path to store the images.
• Run 'training.py'
• Run 'detection.py' and replace your name in the code.
